### **Ordering System with UI**

**Objective:** Develop a system to manage the ordering process in a restaurant, complete with a user interface.

**Setup:**

1. **HTML Structure:** Create a webpage layout containing:

   - A section to add new dishes to the menu.
   - A section to place orders.
   - A section to calculate and display the total bill for a table.
   - Display sections for menus, tables, and orders.

2. **CSS Styling:** Design the webpage with a clear visual distinction between each section. Use different colors, padding, borders, and fonts to enhance the user experience.

**Data Structure:**

- Use three arrays:
  - `menus`: To store dish objects with properties such as unique identifier, name, and price.
  - `tables`: To store table objects with a unique identifier property.
  - `orders`: To store order objects with properties to identify the table and the dish being ordered.
